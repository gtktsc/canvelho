![2023-08-30_22-02-23 (4)](https://github.com/gtktsc/canvelho/assets/17948218/f5eec7ec-a4eb-401f-a924-a57f6f35ca31)


## Why? 

This initiative aims to develop an intuitive rich text editor on the canvas, reminiscent of the functionality seen in Google Docs. Its purpose is to address a notable gap within the open-source community and provide a user-friendly solution.

The project is currently in its developmental phase, and we welcome you to openly bring up any concerns or feedback by raising an issue. Your input is highly valued as we work towards refining the editor.
